# mechanobio_bone_stimulated_differentiation

Mechanobiological model for bone regeneration in large bone defect scaffold
Baseline model adapted from Checa et al 2011: coupled agent-based model and finite element analysis (with Abaqus)
Using Lacroix & Prendergast mechanoregulation theory

Graft stimulatory effect on differentiation: 50% of the MSCs in graft presence differentiate into new phenotypes (vs. 30% in the absence of graft).
