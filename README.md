# mechanobio_bone_non-stimulated

Mechanobiological model for bone regeneration in large bone defect scaffold

Baseline model adapted from Checa et al 2011: coupled agent-based model and finite element analysis (with Abaqus)

Using Lacroix & Prendergast mechanoregulation theory

Non-stimulated bone regeneration model: MSCs lose their activity after a latency period of 15 days.
