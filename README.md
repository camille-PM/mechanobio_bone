# mechanobio_bone_stimulated_migration

Mechanobiological model for bone regeneration in large bone defect scaffold
Baseline model adapted from Checa et al 2011: coupled agent-based model and finite element analysis (with Abaqus)
Using Lacroix & Prendergast mechanoregulation theory

Graft stimulatory effect on cell migration: after the 15-day latency period, only the MSCs contained in the bone graft are allowed to migrate
