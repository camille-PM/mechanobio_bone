# mechanobio_bone_osteoconduction_surf_migration

Mechanobiological model for bone regeneration in large bone defect scaffold
Baseline model adapted from Checa et al 2011: coupled agent-based model and finite element analysis (with Abaqus)
Using Lacroix & Prendergast mechanoregulation theory

+ Graft osteoconductive effects: stimulatory effects on cell migration and proliferation
+ Surface-guided ECM deposition
