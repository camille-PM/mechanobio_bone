# mechanobio_bone_surface_deposition

Mechanobiological model for bone regeneration in large bone defect scaffold
Baseline model adapted from Checa et al 2011: coupled agent-based model and finite element analysis (with Abaqus)
Using Lacroix & Prendergast mechanoregulation theory

Non-stimulated bone regeneration model + surface-guided ECM deposition (MSC differentiation).
