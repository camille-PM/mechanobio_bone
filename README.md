# mechanobio_bone_stimulated_proliferation

Mechanobiological model for bone regeneration in large bone defect scaffold
Baseline model adapted from Checa et al 2011: coupled agent-based model and finite element analysis (with Abaqus)
Using Lacroix & Prendergast mechanoregulation theory

Bone graft stimulatory effect on cell proliferation: after the 15-day latency period, only the cells in presence of graft are allowed to proliferate.
