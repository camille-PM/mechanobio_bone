# mechanobio_bone_graft_effects_and_cells

Mechanobiological model for bone regeneration in large bone defect scaffold

Baseline model adapted from Checa et al 2011: coupled agent-based model and finite element analysis (with Abaqus)

Using Lacroix & Prendergast mechanoregulation theory

Graft stimulatory effects on cell migration, proliferation and differentiation combined together
Addition of initially seeded MSCs in the graft (0.1%).
