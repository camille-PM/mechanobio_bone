# mechanobio_bone_graft_cells

Mechanobiological model for bone regeneration in large bone defect scaffold
Baseline model adapted from Checa et al 2011: coupled agent-based model and finite element analysis (with Abaqus)
Using Lacroix & Prendergast mechanoregulation theory

Graft-contained MSCs are initially seeded in 0.1% volume of the graft. Associated with non-stimulated bone regeneration model.
